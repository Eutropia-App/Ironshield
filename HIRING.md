# We're Hiring Real Engineers
We’re not looking for people who want a “nice” job they can show to a future hiring manager.  
This is **not** a resume-building gig where you spend 18 months centering divs and attending retros.  
This is a place that *won’t insult* the **time**, **intelligence**, or **problem-solving ability** of real engineers.

We pay well because we expect high performance. However, here, **high performance isn’t ticket velocity**.  
It’s how effectively you solve hard, technical problems that don’t have clean documentation or stackoverflow answers.

IronShield is building the most aggressive, high-performance Layer 7 firewall on the internet—Rust-powered, compiled to WASM, and deployed entirely at the edge. We stop scrapers, API abuse, and botnets *before* they touch your backend.

But the tech stack is just a reflection of the mindset.  
We’re not scaling through middle managers, OKRs, or ticket grooming.  
This company runs on **weaponized autism**, and we’re looking for more of it.

## What Makes IronShield Different

We’re not a startup with a Notion board and good vibes.  
We’re a security company built by people who hate inefficiency, ceremony, and fake productivity.

You don’t need permission to do cool things here.  
See a performance issue? Fix it. Think you can optimize a system? Start working on it.  
You won’t get blocked by approvals or roadmap committees.

**We don’t do traditional hours.**  
We have one short meeting every Monday to keep everyone synced.  
The rest of the time is yours: focused, heads-down, and uninterrupted.

We use **Discord**, not Slack.  
Better threading, better voice, better bots. Ignore the gamer branding—it works.

**We’re OE-friendly.**  
If you're not working on something cool on the side, we might actually be a little disappointed.  
People who build weird tools for fun, run indie projects, or consult on the side are exactly our demographic.  
Just let us know what you're doing. As long as you're shipping excellent work quickly, we're good.

**AI tooling is fine—but only if you understand the code.**  
We’re not fans of “vibe coding” where people prompt ChatGPT and hope for the best.  
But if AI helps you go faster while maintaining mastery, that’s great.

**We want you to become the most skilled developer you can be.**  
You’ll likely be unfamiliar with *part* of our stack—and that’s by design.  
Unsolved problems aren’t solved yet. We care more about your ability to **learn fast** than your resume’s keyword density.  
Take an hour or two each day on company time to learn a skill you think applies.  
We want our engineers to become **fluent across the stack**, not siloed.

We also believe in hiring **versatile, high-agency engineers** who can be reassigned internally as needs change—not people who’ve spent 10 years optimizing the same React modal. If you’re sharp and adaptable, there’s always room to grow.

## What You’ll Actually Do

- Write **Rust** targeting `wasm32-unknown-unknown` for edge deployment via Cloudflare Workers.
- Build adaptive **proof-of-work** systems that escalate based on client behavior.
- Create **scraper poison mazes** that confuse and corrupt LLMs.
- Design **edge-native defenses** that throttle malicious traffic before it hits origin.
- Work independently on unsolved problems—fast.

---

## What You Won’t Do

- Attend daily standups.
- Groom Jira tickets.
- Write a cover letter.
- Do six rounds of interviews.
- Reverse a linked list on a whiteboard.
- Argue about “communication styles.”
- Wait on approval to fix obvious problems.

---

## How We Hire

- **No cover letter.**  
  Don’t send one. We don't want to read your fan fiction about why you're passionate about cybersecurity. This isn't one of those "It's optional but shows commitment" things. We. Will. Not. Read It.

- **One interview.**  
  No Leetcode. No trivia. No Carl asking about linked lists.  
  Leetcode is cope for non-technical hiring managers.  
  We write and ship. You do too.  
  Come ready to nerd out about something hard you've built—ideally something no one told you to build.

- **Show us something real.**  
  A GitHub repo, side project, exploit, compiler, or cursed performance fix.  
  If it’s interesting, we’ll know.

---

## Who Should *Not* Apply

**This job is not for most people.**  
We believe in being upfront and honest. We don’t want to waste your time—or ours.

You’ll likely be miserable here if:

- You think **AWS is the right way** to build infra.
- You believe **JavaScript is a good language**, and **TypeScript makes it better**.
- You’ve never self-hosted anything.
- You like **low-code tools**, **clickOps**, or **no-code platforms**.
- You rely on **project managers** to tell you what matters.
- You value **“communication skills”** over technical depth.
- You use **professional corpo email speak** to sound impressive.  
  (We talk normally. That includes swearing when we’re mad. It’s fine.)
- You want a job, not a mission.
- You think **“influence without authority”** is a valid skillset.
- You’re a **LinkedIn thought leader**.
- You only work well in one narrow niche and don’t want to learn new things.

---

## Who Will Thrive Here

You’ll fit in if:

- You run **Gentoo**, **Arch**, **NixOS**, or something even more cursed.
- You obsessively **self-host** your mail, DNS, monitoring, pastebins, and maybe your own git.
- You think **proprietary cloud software** is a trap.
- You’ve built your own **language**, **VM**, or **compiler** just to understand the internals.
- You’ve done **offensive security**, CTFs, reverse engineering, or rootkit-level work.
- You care more about **latency** than metrics dashboards.
- You’d rather read RFCs than startup blogs.
- You’re **neurodivergent**, **autistic**, or just naturally socially awkward—and have trouble fitting into most PM-driven environments.  
  **If you hate small talk, this is the place for you.**
- You ship great code, independently, fast—and don’t want to be micromanaged.
- You’re juggling other projects or jobs and still ship faster than most full-timers. That’s not a problem—it’s a signal.
- You want to keep leveling up and become fluent across the entire stack.
