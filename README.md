# IronShield

## Enterprise-Level DDoS Protection at Startup-Friendly Prices

### What is IronShield?

IronShield is a powerful, Rust-based Layer 7 (L7) DDoS and bot protection solution specifically built for APIs, crypto projects, Web3 platforms, self-hosted applications, and startups that demand enterprise-level security but lack enterprise-level budgets. Primarily designed as a solution to be effortlessly deployed on Cloudflare's infrastructure, IronShield provides robust protection without relying exclusively on Cloudflare's built-in bot detection mechanisms, ensuring compatibility with privacy-focused networks like Tor and VPNs, essential for cryptocurrency and privacy-first services.

IronShield delivers top-tier protection without the heavy costs associated with traditional enterprise solutions like Cloudflare Enterprise and provides a scalable infrastructure solution instead of the common janky self-rolled options currently prevalent.

### The Problem

You've built an innovative, valuable service—but now you're under attack:

- Your APIs are overwhelmed by thousands of malicious requests per second.
- Attackers easily bypass basic rate limiting and firewalls.
- You're suffering from Layer 7 DDoS attacks targeting your application's logic, not just network bandwidth.
- Cloudflare Enterprise protection is prohibitively expensive (often thousands per month).
- Downtime directly costs your business users, revenue, and credibility.

Open-source alternatives often fall short:
- Frequently outdated or abandoned.
- Resource-intensive or poorly optimized.
- Complex and burdensome to configure and deploy.
- Ineffective against advanced, modern attack vectors.

### Why IronShield?

IronShield modernizes and drastically improves upon the conceptual foundation set by solutions like PoW-Shield, leveraging Rust’s unparalleled performance, memory safety, and concurrency to provide sophisticated DDoS protection that's faster, safer, and dramatically more efficient.

Additionally, IronShield aims to be the "Vercel for Cloudflare"—providing a user-friendly, no-code, 1-click security solution. While Cloudflare offers powerful tools for technical users, IronShield bridges the gap, delivering streamlined, accessible cybersecurity to everyone.

Unlike previous solutions like PoW-Shield, which required running directly on your server and only filtering traffic after it had already reached your infrastructure, IronShield is specifically designed to operate on the edge. This means malicious traffic is intercepted and blocked before it ever touches your backend, greatly reducing the risk and resource drain on your systems.

### Key Features

- **Proof of Work (PoW) Challenges:** Forces attackers to consume significant CPU resources, making automated attacks economically unsustainable.
- **High-Speed Rust Proxy:** Built for extreme throughput and minimal latency, ensuring protection doesn't degrade user experience.
- **Adaptive Rate Limiting:** Intelligently allows legitimate traffic patterns while throttling malicious requests.
- **Advanced Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Detects and blocks malicious patterns before they reach your application.
- **Distributed & Scalable:** Deploy horizontally across multiple nodes and infrastructure seamlessly.
- **Data Privacy:** Traffic stays securely within your infrastructure without routing through third-party services.
- **Minimal Resource Footprint:** Uses significantly fewer resources than Node.js or Python-based solutions.
- **AI Scraper Maze (Optional “AI Revenge Mode”):** Deploy decoy content designed specifically to confuse, poison, and frustrate AI-powered web scrapers and data crawlers.

### Ideal for:

- **Crypto Exchanges & DeFi Platforms:** Protect sensitive APIs from targeted attacks without blocking privacy-focused traffic.
- **Web3 Infrastructure Providers:** Guard critical API infrastructure with reliable security.
- **NFT Projects:** Ensure stability during high-demand mint events.
- **Blockchain Explorers:** Maintain uptime and data integrity under heavy load.
- **Privacy-First Services:** Avoid reliance on third-party security services and maintain compatibility with Tor and VPN users.
- **Self-Hosted Businesses:** Achieve enterprise-grade security on your own infrastructure.
- **Small and Medium Businesses:** Gain access to powerful security without breaking the bank.
- **Teams Demanding Full Stack Control:** Deploy and manage security independently, free from external dependencies.

### How IronShield Works

IronShield operates as a secure reverse proxy in front of your application:

1. **Client Request:** User requests access your application.
2. **PoW Challenge:** IronShield issues a computational challenge executed via JavaScript or WebAssembly.
3. **Verification:** The user's browser completes the computational puzzle, demonstrating genuine intent.
4. **Token Generation:** Verified clients receive a time-limited access token.
5. **Access Granted:** Requests with valid tokens seamlessly reach your application.
6. **Malicious Requests Blocked:** Bots and attackers, unable to afford the computational overhead, are effectively blocked before hitting your server.

For legitimate users, the computational cost is imperceptible. However, for attackers, it imposes a severe penalty, making large-scale attacks financially and computationally impractical.

### Future-Proof Your Security

IronShield plans to support self-hosted Web Application Firewall (WAF) deployments, offering complete flexibility for organizations requiring additional control or regulatory compliance. 

### Getting Started

Deploy IronShield effortlessly via Cloudflare Workers or your own infrastructure:
- Clone the IronShield repository.
- Configure your security rules and PoW settings.
- Deploy using Docker, Kubernetes, or directly via Cloudflare Workers.
